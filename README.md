# Flashcards
This project was a mess for me, lot of new things I learned. SQL Server, DTOs to change how I want to display information to the user, etc. 
This led to my final product being vastly different than my original framework plan. I hope to take these lessons and have a much cleaner next project.
I also slacked on saving work when the day was done, leading to their only being the init commit and the final commit. Next project I will "commit" (haha) commiting
at the end of the coding session.
